# Udacity React Nanodegree Program - MyReads App Project

## How it works

The app tracks all the books you are currently reading, want to read or have read. 
Books in those categories are displayed on their respective 'bookshelves'.

You can move books between shelves, or remove them from being tracked by using the 
drop-down menu on each book cover.

To add a new book to a shelf, use the search facility to search on either a book's 
title or its author. Add books to shelves using the same drop-down menu.

## Getting started

Yarn was used as the package manager. Use `yarn` or `yarn install` to install all the required npm modules.

To start the dev server, type `yarn start` in a new terminal window.

To stop the dev server, press `CTRL + C`.

## Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results. 

## create-react-app

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). You can find more information on how to perform common tasks [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).
